## What is vue-chessboard

vue-chessboard is Vue component. It provides chessboard view and functionality to your projects. This is my graduation project so there may be bug or performance issues.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @ibrahimdeniz/vue-chessboard

#yarn
yarn add @ibrahimdeniz/vue-chessboard
```

# Bare Minimum

```vue
<template>
  <chess-board @onMovePlayed="onMovePlayed" />
</template>

<script>
import { ChessBoard } from "@ibrahimdeniz/vue-chessboard";
import "@ibrahimdeniz/vue-chessboard/dist/style.css";

export default {
  name: "App",
  data() {
    return {
      chessBoardSize: 800,
    };
  },
  components: {
    ChessBoard,
  },
  methods: {
    onMovePlayed({ move, game }) {
      game.makeMove(move);
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

## Example

### Random Move Engine

```vue
<template>
  <chess-board
    :size="chessBoardSize"
    v-model:fen="fen"
    @onMovePlayed="onMovePlayed"
    @onGameOver="onGameOver"
    disableBlackMoves
  />
</template>

<script>
import { ChessBoard } from "@ibrahimdeniz/vue-chessboard";
import "@ibrahimdeniz/vue-chessboard/dist/style.css";

const ratio = 0.8;

export default {
  name: "App",
  data() {
    return {
      chessBoardSize: 800,
      fen: "",
      winner: null,
    };
  },
  components: {
    ChessBoard,
  },
  methods: {
    onMovePlayed({ move, game }) {
      game.makeMove(move);
      if (game.moves.length) game.makeMove(this.makeRandomMove(game.moves));
    },
    onGameOver({ winner }) {
      this.winner = winner;
    },
    makeRandomMove(moves) {
      const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * moves.length);
      return moves[randomIndex];
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

## Props

```js
props: {
  fen: {
    type: String,
    default: DEFAULT_FEN,
  },
  size: {
    type: Number,
    default: 800,
  },
  game: {
    type: ChessGame, // From my chess service
    default: new ChessGame(),
  },
  disableWhiteMoves: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  },
  disableBlackMoves: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  }
}

## Emits

### @onMovePlayed({ move: Move, game: ChessGame }) : Required

When any move selected, this emit executed. Move and ChessGame types are from my chess services. I will refer them coming soon.

onMovePlayed({ move, game }) {
      game.makeMove(move);
},
```

### @onGameOver({ winner: "black" | "white" | "draw" , game: ChessGame }) : Optional
